Bitly addition by: Masuga Design

<pre>
{exp:shortn_tweet title="{title}" url="{url_title_path=weblog/item}" short_url="bit.ly"}
  <a href="{twt:twitter_url}{twt:title} {twt:title_url}">Tweet this</a>
{/exp:shortn_tweet}
</pre>

Remember that if you are using bit.ly as your URL shortener that you will need an account. You will then have to add your username and bit.ly API key to the top of the plugin:

<pre>
	var $bitly_login = 'YOURBITLYLOGIN'; // enter your bit.ly login here
	var $bitly_apikey = 'R_01234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstu'; // enter your key here
</pre>
